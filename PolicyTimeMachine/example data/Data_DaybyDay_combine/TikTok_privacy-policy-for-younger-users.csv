20211108,none,January 2020,"Privacy Policy for Younger Users Last updated: January 2020 TikTok Inc. (“TikTok”, “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of children. This Privacy Policy for Younger Users explains our information collection practices with respect to information provided by users under the age of 13 on the under-13 experience of the TikTok mobile application for users in the United States (“Younger Users” or “you”). The TikTok experience for Younger Users is designed especially for users under 13 residing in the United States. The experience allows these users to engage with TikTok’s fun video features while limiting the information collected from them. Younger users can view videos from other creators and explore their creativity by capturing their own videos with music and special effects. While Younger Users may save these videos directly to their device, the videos will not be saved by us or viewable by other users. Younger Users also have a more limited interactive experience: for example, they can’t exchange messages with other users, and other users can’t view their profiles. What information do we collect from Younger Users? When a Younger User registers for TikTok, we collect only limited information, including username, password, and birthday. We may also collect certain information automatically from the user’s device, including internet or other network activity information such as device ID, IP address, web browser type and version, country-level location, as well as certain app activity data, such as video watches, time in the app, and general usage data. How do we use the information we collect? We use the information we collect to provide and support our services. For example, we use username and password to authenticate Younger Users. We may use the information that is collected automatically to provide personalized content; serve contextual advertising; perform analytics and troubleshoot; protect the security or integrity of the user and our service; and ensure legal or regulatory compliance. Younger Users cannot publicly share personal information, including videos or profile information. How do we share the information we collect? We share the information we collect with our corporate group and with service providers as necessary for them to perform a business purpose, professional service, or technology support function for us. We may disclose personal information if permitted or required by law (i) in response to a court order or a subpoena; (ii) in response to a law enforcement or public agency’s (including schools or children services) request; (iii) if we believe disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime, facilitate an investigation related to public safety or protect the safety of Younger Users using our sites or applications; (iv) to protect the security or integrity of our sites, applications, and other technology, as well as the technology of our service providers; or (v) enable us to take precautions against liability. The security of your information We take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this policy. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your information, for example, by encryption, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted through the Platform; any transmission is at your own risk. We have appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of you and other users. We maintain these technical and organizational measures and will amend them from time to time to improve the overall security of our systems. TikTok does not sell the information of Younger Users to third parties. Choices You may submit a request to access or delete the information we have collected about you by sending your request to us at the email or physical address provided in the Contact section at the bottom of this policy. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law and subject to proper verification. And we do not discriminate based on the exercise of any privacy rights that you might have. Changes We will generally notify all users of any material changes to this policy, through a notice on the platform. However, users should look at this policy regularly to check for any changes. We will also update the “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy, which reflects the effective date of such policy.
