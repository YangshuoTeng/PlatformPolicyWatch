20230420,none,5 November 2020,"TikTok Platform Cookies Policy Last Updated: 5 November 2020 This Cookies Policy applies whenever you see our Platform. â Platformâ  includes any services provided by TikTok, including the advertiser and developer products available via  TikTok For Business  and  TikTok for Developers , with the exception of those described in our separate  Website Cookies Policy . Where we refer to â TikTok â, â we â or â us â in this Cookies Policy, we mean TikTok Technology Limited, an Irish company, and TikTok Information Technologies UK Limited, a UK company. Like many websites and apps, our Platform uses cookies and other tracking technologies such as software development kits (SDKs), pixels and local storage. These technologies allow us to store information or gain access to information stored on your device to enable certain features and distinguish your device from others. Tracking technologies are used by most apps to recognise that a device is the same as one used previously and to understand some of its characteristics so that we can serve you advertising, measure the performance of those ads, and to improve your experience. This policy explains how we use these technologies, and the choices you have to control them. Unless otherwise stated in this policy, our  Privacy Policy  applies to the data we collect. 1. What technologies are used? Our Platform uses the following kinds of technologies: Cookies:   Cookies are small text files that enable us and our service providers and partners to uniquely identify your browser or device for various purposes, including those described above. Cookies normally work by assigning a unique number to your device and are stored on your browser by the websites that you visit as well as third party service providers and partners to those websites.Â  Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are ""session cookies"", meaning that they exist only while your browser is open and are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Session cookies cannot be used to track your browser or device from website to website. Other cookies are ""persistent cookies"", meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. Most persistent cookies are set to automatically expire after a defined duration (for example, a few days, weeks or months). When you return to that website (or visit other websites that use the same cookies) the website provider or its service providers can recognise the persistent cookies they have set and recognise your browsing device. Local storage:   Local storage files are created by apps and websites to store information locally on your device. They are very similar to cookies, but can have slightly different properties (for example, local storage can be used to store more information and can be stored in a different location on your device to cookies). Local storage is normally used to speed up app and site functionality and remember your preferences. Application Programmable Interface (API): An API is a piece of software which helps two or more applications to talk to one another. We use them to communicate between TikTok and our service providers. Software Development Kits (SDKs): SDKs are pieces of code that enable data to be collected about your device, network and interaction with a website. Like cookies, they generally operate by assigning your device a unique number. Pixels: Pixels are small 1 pixel x 1 pixel invisible image files that are embedded in certain website pages.Â  They can be used to collect information about your visit to that website page.Â Â  When you open a website page with an embedded pixel, the page will automatically run simple code that downloads the 1x1 image file to your device.Â  At the same time, the code also passes certain information about your device and your actions on the website. Your interest in the website can then be logged and used for analytics or advertising purposes. Mobile advertising IDs: Your device has a unique number used by TikTok and our service providers to recognise your device. Where you have provided your consent, this allows personalised ads to be delivered to your device and to measure the effectiveness of those ads.  Learn more  about how to control your advertising ID. 2. Categories of tracking technologies The types of tracking technologies used by us and our partners in connection with the provision of the Platform can be classified into the following categories. Some of these categories are âessentialâ to provide you with the services you have requested, such as to allow you to log into secure areas of the Platform. The following is a list of of the categories of tracking technologies we use: Identification and security :   We recognise you when you return to our Platform to make sure that you are the right user and to prevent activity that violates our policies.Â  For example, we check what country you are using the TikTok app from to detect if someone may be trying to fraudulently access your account. Content personalisation :   We use these technologies to ensure that we can serve you with personalised content.Â  For example, each User is givenÂ  a unique TikTok ID number. We use this to provide you with tailored content that will be of interest to you. Remembering your preferences :   We need to remember the settings you have chosen on the Platform so that they work how you want them to.Â  For example, we use these technologies in order to remember what languages you want to see content in, the privacy settings you apply to your account and/or videos and your Digital Wellbeing choices. Functionality :  Functionality tracking technologies help to make the Platform work more efficiently and to improve and optimize your experience. For example, we determine which device you use, the software version and the screen dimensions so that we can ensure the TikTok app functions correctly. We also determine whether your battery is running low so that we can optimise the TikTok app and we make sure that content loads and plays correctly. Analytics : We use analytics tracking technologies to analyse how you use the Platform, including which pages you view most often, how you interact with the content, measure any errors that occur and test different design ideas. The information is used to report and evaluate your activities and patterns as a user of the Platform. For example, we may test new video creation features to help us decide which features users prefer. Advertising and measurement : Our Platform uses advertising and measurement tracking technologies. These tracking technologies help us and our advertisers show you relevant advertising and measure the performance of ad campaigns. We also use these technologies to promote TikTok on the other platforms and websites and measure their effectiveness. For example, we will learn from our advertiser about whether you viewed their products or bought something so we can learn how effective the ad was. If youâve already shown interest in an ad, we might show you it again, or we might limit the number of times we show it to you.Â  3. Do other parties use these technologies onÂ  our Platform? Tracking technologies can either be âfirst-partyâ or âthird-partyâ. First-party tracking technologies refers to tracking technologies that we set and use directly. Third-party tracking technologies refer to tracking technologies set by third parties (such as our analytics or advertising service providers). Our partners may use these technologies on our Platform to help us and our advertisers understand how effective their ads are and to compare this to their campaigns on other websites and apps. You can find a list of these partners in the  Cookies Partner List . 4. How can I control these technologies? You can control how these technologies are used: Personalised Ads in the TikTok app.  You are in full control of whether TikTok serves you with personalised ads in the TikTok app. We do not serve personalised ads without your consent. You can switch on personalised ads by clicking on âMeâ in the TikTok app, visiting the settings page by pressing on the three dots in the top right corner, then clicking on âPersonalization and dataâ then using the toggle. You can change this setting at any time. Advertising ID.  You can tailor your device settings to control your advertising ID: On Apple devices, you can enable the âLimit Ad Trackingâ setting in your device settings.Â Â  On Android devices, you can enable the âOpt out of Ads Personalizationâ in your device settings. Partner opt-outs.  Many of the partners we work with also provide opt-outs on their own websites. You can find details of this in their own policies, which are linked to from our  Cookies Partner List . As mentioned above, some uses of these technologies are essential for the functioning of the Platform and so you cannot deactivate them.Â  5.
