These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Facebook Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=igtos), provided to you by Facebook Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook Ireland Limited.  
### **The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):
*   **Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content)) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
*   **Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.**  
    To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
### **The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content) explains how we collect, use, and share information across the [Facebook Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?helpref=page_content). It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the [Instagram Privacy and Security Settings](http://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?helpref=page_content).
### **Your Commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
**Who Can Use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
*   You must be at least 13 years old.
*   You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
*   We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
*   You must not be a convicted sex offender.
**How You Can't Use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.
*   **You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**  
    You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information). Also, you may not impersonate someone you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
*   **You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorized purpose.**
*   **You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?helpref=page_content), [Instagram Platform Policy](https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/), and [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines).** Learn how to report conduct or content in our [Help Center](http://help.instagram.com/?helpref=page_content).
*   **You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.**
*   **You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorized ways.**  
    This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
*   **You can't attempt to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username) or solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users.**
*   **You can't post private or confidential information or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property.**  
    Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, [here](http://help.instagram.com/535503073130320?helpref=page_content).
*   **You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.**
**Permissions You Give to Us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service. Instead, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). You can end this license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) and visit the [Instagram Help Center](http://help.instagram.com/).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](http://help.instagram.com/615366948510230) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
### **Additional Rights We Retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://www.instagram-brand.com/) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
### **Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account**
*   We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119)), or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your account) immediately if you: clearly, seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are required to do so by law. If we take action to remove your content for violating our Community Guidelines, or disable or terminate your account, we will notify you where appropriate. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Center](http://help.instagram.com/).
*   Content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies and will still be visible where others have shared it. This paragraph, and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree,"" will still apply even after your account is terminated or deleted.
### **Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**
**Our Agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines), and your use of our API is subject to our [Platform Policy](https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/api/). If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**
*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure, and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. Provided we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury, or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
**How We Will Handle Disputes.**
> If you are a consumer and habitually reside in a Member State of the European Union, the laws of that Member State will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms (""claim""), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that Member State that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved in a competent court in the Republic of Ireland and that Irish law will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
**Unsolicited Material.**
> We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
### **Updating These Terms**
We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).

However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account.

### **Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account**
*   We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119)), or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119)), if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights, or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems, or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Center](http://help.instagram.com/). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Our right to terminate for good cause remains unaffected. Good cause is specifically if a party violates obligations under these Terms, any laws, third party rights, or privacy policies, and the terminating party cannot be expected to continue the contractual relationship under consideration of all circumstances of the individual case and having weighed the interests of both parties up until the agreed time of termination or the expiry of a period of notice. A termination for good cause is possible only within a reasonable time frame after becoming aware of the violation.
*   If the good cause is a breach of an obligation of these Terms, termination is permitted only after an unsuccessful granted cure duty has expired, or after an unsuccessful warning. However, a time limit for remedy is not necessary if the other side refuses to fulfill their obligations seriously and with finality or if special circumstances justify an immediate termination, having weighed the interests of both parties. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Center](http://help.instagram.com/).
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled, or deleted.
### **Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**
**Our Agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines), and your use of our API is subject to our [Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/terms). If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**
*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure, and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. Provided we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury, or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
**How We Will Handle Disputes.**

These Terms of Use govern your use of Instagram and provide information about the Instagram Service, outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Facebook Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=igtos), provided to you by Facebook Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook Ireland Limited.  
### **The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects (the Service):
*   **Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content)) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
*   **Ensuring a stable global infrastructure for our Service.**  
    To provide our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
### **The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content) explains how we collect, use, and share information across the [Facebook Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?helpref=page_content). It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the [Instagram Privacy and Security Settings](http://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?helpref=page_content).

You can end this license anytime by deleting your content or account. However, content will continue to appear if you shared it with others and they have not deleted it. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) and visit the [Instagram Help Center](http://help.instagram.com/).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](http://help.instagram.com/615366948510230) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**

We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your account) immediately if you: clearly, seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are required to do so by law.

### **Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**
**Our Agreement.**

If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms).

We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](http://help.instagram.com/537518769659039?helpref=page_content).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content.

*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled, or deleted.

If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.

**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**
*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure, and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. Provided we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury, or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
**How We Will Handle Disputes.**
> If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.

> We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
### **Updating These Terms**
We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect.

------------------------
Bienvenue sur Instagram !  
Les présentes Conditions d’utilisation (ou « Conditions ») régissent votre utilisation d’Instagram, sauf lorsque nous indiquons expressément que des conditions distinctes (et non les présentes) s’appliquent, et fournissent des informations sur le Service Instagram (le « Service »), détaillé ci-dessous. En créant un compte Instagram ou en utilisant Instagram, vous acceptez les présentes Conditions. Les Conditions de Service de Facebook ne s’appliquent pas à ce Service.  
Le Service Instagram est l’un des [Produits Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=igtos) fournis par Facebook, Inc. Par conséquent, les présentes Conditions d’utilisation constituent un accord entre vous et Facebook, Inc.  
### **Le Service Instagram**
Nous acceptons de vous fournir le Service Instagram. Le Service comprend l’ensemble des produits, des fonctionnalités, des applications, des services, des technologies et des logiciels Instagram que nous vous fournissons afin d’accomplir la vocation d’Instagram : vous rapprocher des personnes et des choses que vous aimez. Le Service inclut les aspects suivants :
*   **Offrir des opportunités personnalisées pour créer, communiquer, établir des liens, découvrir et partager**  
    Chaque personne est différente. Nous souhaitons renforcer vos relations au moyen d’expériences partagées qui comptent à vos yeux. Ainsi, nous créons des systèmes qui tentent de déterminer quelles personnes et quels intérêts comptent pour vous et pour les autres, et nous utilisons ces informations afin de vous aider à créer, à trouver, à vivre et à partager des expériences importantes à vos yeux. Cela consiste notamment à mettre en avant du contenu, des fonctionnalités, des offres et des comptes susceptibles de vous intéresser, et de vous offrir divers moyens d’utiliser Instagram en fonction de ce que vous et d’autres personnes faites sur Instagram et en dehors.
*   **Créer un environnement positif, inclusif et sûr**  
    Nous développons et utilisons des outils, et offrons des ressources aux membres de notre communauté afin de contribuer à rendre leurs expériences positives et inclusives, y compris lorsque nous pensons qu’ils pourraient avoir besoin de notre aide. Nous avons également des équipes et des systèmes qui fonctionnent pour lutter contre les abus et les violations de nos Conditions et politiques, ainsi que contre les comportements préjudiciables et trompeurs. Nous utilisons toutes les informations à notre disposition, y compris les vôtres, pour tenter de maintenir la sécurité de notre plateforme. Il se peut également que nous partagions des informations concernant une utilisation abusive ou du contenu préjudiciable avec d’autres Entités Facebook ou avec les autorités. Apprenez-en davantage dans la [Politique d’utilisation des données](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content).
*   **Développer et utiliser des technologies nous permettant d’offrir constamment des services à notre communauté grandissante**  
    La gestion et l’analyse des informations pour notre communauté grandissante sont essentielles à notre Service. Une grande partie de notre Service consiste à créer et à utiliser des technologies de pointe capables de personnaliser, de protéger et d’améliorer notre Service à une très grande échelle pour une communauté mondiale étendue. Des technologies telles que l’intelligence artificielle et l’apprentissage automatique nous offrent la capacité d’appliquer des processus complexes à tout notre Service. Les technologies automatisées nous permettent également d’assurer le fonctionnement et l’intégrité de notre Service.
*   **Fournir des expériences homogènes et fluides sur les autres Produits des Entités Facebook**  
    Instagram fait partie des Entités Facebook, qui partagent des technologies, des systèmes, des statistiques et des informations, y compris des informations vous concernant dont nous disposons (apprenez-en davantage dans la [Politique d’utilisation des données](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content)), afin de fournir des services de meilleure qualité, plus sûrs et plus sécurisés. Nous proposons également différentes manières d’interagir parmi les Produits des Entités Facebook que vous utilisez et nous avons conçu des systèmes offrant des expériences homogènes et fluides sur l’ensemble des Produits des Entités Facebook.
*   **Assurer l’accès à notre Service.**  
    Afin de faire fonctionner notre Service à l’international, nous devons stocker et transférer des données à travers nos systèmes dans le monde entier, y compris en dehors de votre pays de résidence. L’utilisation de cette infrastructure globale est nécessaire et essentielle pour fournir notre Service. Cette infrastructure peut être détenue ou exploitée par Facebook, Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited ou leurs filiales.
*   **Vous connecter aux marques, aux produits et aux services de la manière la mieux adaptée pour vous**  
    Nous utilisons les données d’Instagram et d’autres Produits des Entités Facebook, ainsi que de partenaires tiers afin de vous montrer des publicités, des offres et d’autres contenus sponsorisés qui, à notre avis, vous intéresseront. Nous faisons de notre mieux pour que ce contenu soit aussi pertinent que vos autres expériences sur Instagram.
*   **Recherche et innovation**  
    Nous utilisons les informations à notre disposition afin d’étudier notre Service et de collaborer avec des tiers sur de la recherche, dans le but d’améliorer notre Service et de contribuer au bien-être de notre communauté.
### **Comment notre Service est-il financé**
Au lieu de payer pour l’utilisation d’Instagram, en utilisant le Service couvert par les présentes Conditions, vous reconnaissez que nous pouvons vous montrer les publicités payées par les entreprises et organisations pour que nous les promouvions sur les [Produits des Entités Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?helpref=page_content) et en dehors. Nous utilisons vos données personnelles, telles que les informations concernant votre activité et vos intérêts, afin de vous montrer des publicités plus pertinentes pour vous.
Nous vous montrons des publicités pertinentes et utiles sans informer les annonceurs de votre identité. Nous ne vendons pas vos données personnelles. Nous autorisons les annonceurs à nous donner des informations, telles que leur objectif commercial et le type d’audience à qui ils souhaitent montrer leurs publicités. Puis, nous montrons leur publicité aux personnes susceptibles d’être intéressées.
De plus, nous envoyons aux annonceurs des rapports sur les performances de leurs publicités pour les aider à comprendre comment les gens interagissent avec leur contenu sur Instagram et en dehors. Nous fournissons par exemple des informations démographiques générales et liées aux centres d’intérêts aux annonceurs pour les aider à mieux comprendre leur audience. Nous ne partageons aucune information qui vous identifie directement (des informations comme votre nom ou adresse e-mail qui, en elles-mêmes, peuvent servir à vous contacter ou à vous identifier) sans avoir obtenu votre autorisation spécifique. Découvrez comment fonctionnent les publicités Instagram [ici](http://help.instagram.com/537518769659039?helpref=page_content).
Vous pouvez voir du contenu de marque sur Instagram publié par des titulaires de compte qui font la promotion de produits ou services sur la base d’une relation commerciale avec le partenaire commercial mentionné dans leur contenu. Pour en savoir plus sur ce point, cliquez [ici](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/116947042301556?helpref=page_content).

*   **Vous ne pouvez pas publier les informations privées ou confidentielles d’une autre personne sans autorisation ou faire quelque chose qui enfreint les droits d’une autre personne, y compris les droits de propriété intellectuelle (ex. violation des droits d’auteur, violation d’une marque de commerce, contrefaçon ou marchandises piratées).**  
    Vous pouvez utiliser les œuvres d’une autre personne sous réserve des exceptions ou limitations aux droits d’auteur et aux droits voisins en vertu de la loi applicable.

    Aucune modification n’est apportée à vos droits sur votre contenu. Nous ne revendiquons pas la propriété du contenu que vous publiez sur ou par le biais du Service et vous êtes libre de partager votre contenu avec n’importe qui, où bon vous semble. Cependant, nous avons besoin de certaines autorisations juridiques de votre part (que nous appelons une « licence ») pour fournir le Service. Lorsque vous partagez, publiez ou importez du contenu protégé par des droits de propriété intellectuelle (comme des photos ou des vidéos) sur notre Service ou en rapport avec ce dernier, vous nous accordez une licence non exclusive, gratuite, transférable, sous-licenciable et mondiale pour héberger, utiliser, distribuer, modifier, exécuter, copier, diffuser ou afficher publiquement, traduire et créer des œuvres dérivées de votre contenu (conformément à vos paramètres de confidentialité et d’application). La licence prend fin lorsque votre contenu est supprimé de nos systèmes. Vous pouvez supprimer votre contenu individuellement ou tout d’un coup en supprimant votre compte. Pour en savoir plus sur la manière dont nous utilisons les informations et sur la procédure à suivre pour contrôler ou supprimer votre contenu, consultez la [Politique d’utilisation des données](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) ainsi que les [Pages d’aide Instagram](http://help.instagram.com/).
*   **Autorisation visant à utiliser votre nom d’utilisateur, votre photo de profil et les informations relatives à vos relations et à vos actions en rapport avec les comptes, les publicités et le contenu sponsorisé.**  
    Vous nous donnez l’autorisation d’afficher votre nom d’utilisateur, votre photo de profil ainsi que les informations relatives à vos actions (comme les mentions J’aime) et à vos relations (comme les abonnements) à proximité ou en lien avec les comptes, les publicités, les offres et tout autre contenu sponsorisé que vous suivez ou avec lesquels vous interagissez qui apparaissent dans les Produits Facebook, sans vous verser aucune compensation. Par exemple, nous pouvons montrer que vous avez aimé une publication sponsorisée créée par une marque nous ayant rémunéré pour que nous affichions ses publicités sur Instagram. Comme pour les actions sur d’autres contenus et les abonnements à d’autres comptes, les actions sur du contenu sponsorisé et les abonnements à des comptes sponsorisés sont uniquement visibles par les personnes autorisées à voir ce contenu ou à s’y abonner. Nous respectons également vos paramètres publicitaires. Apprenez-en davantage sur vos paramètres publicitaires [ici](http://help.instagram.com/615366948510230).

### **Droits supplémentaires que nous conservons**
*   Si vous choisissez un nom d’utilisateur ou un identifiant similaire pour votre compte, nous pouvons modifier celui-ci si nous pensons qu’il est approprié ou nécessaire de le faire (par exemple, s’il enfreint la propriété intellectuelle de quelqu’un ou usurpe l’identité d’un autre utilisateur).
*   Si vous utilisez du contenu couvert par des droits de propriété intellectuelle que nous détenons et rendons disponibles dans notre Service (par exemple, des images, des dessins, des vidéos ou des sons que nous fournissons et que vous ajoutez à du contenu que vous créez ou partagez), nous conservons tous les droits relatifs à notre contenu (mais pas au vôtre).

Nous pouvons immédiatement refuser de vous fournir le Service ou arrêter de vous fournir le Service en tout ou en partie (et notamment en supprimant ou en désactivant votre accès aux Produits Facebook et aux Produits des Entités Facebook) afin de protéger notre communauté ou nos services, ou si vous générez un risque ou une responsabilité légale pour nous, enfreignez les présentes Conditions d’utilisation ou nos politiques (notamment nos [Règles de la communauté Instagram](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119)), si vous violez les droits de propriété intellectuelle d’autres personnes à plusieurs reprises ou si la loi l’exige ou le permet. Nous pouvons également modifier ou résilier le Service, supprimer ou bloquer du contenu ou des informations partagés sur notre Service ou cesser de fournir toute ou une partie du Service si nous estimons que cela est raisonnablement nécessaire afin d’éviter ou atténuer des conséquences juridiques ou réglementaires qui nous seraient défavorables. Si vous estimez que votre compte a été supprimé par erreur ou si vous souhaitez désactiver ou supprimer votre compte de façon permanente, consultez nos [Pages d’aide](http://help.instagram.com/). Lorsque vous demandez de supprimer du contenu ou votre compte, le processus de suppression commencera automatiquement dans les 30 jours après votre demande. La suppression de contenu peut prendre jusqu’à 90 jours après le début du processus de suppression.

    *   votre contenu a été utilisé par des tiers conformément à la présente licence, et ils ne l’ont pas supprimé (auquel cas, cette licence continue de s’appliquer jusqu’à la suppression du contenu) ; ou
    *   la suppression dans les 90 jours n’est pas possible en raison de limitations techniques de nos systèmes, auquel cas, nous procèderons à la suppression dès que ce sera possible d’un point de vue technique ; ou
    *   la suppression limiterait notre capacité à :
        *   identifier ou enquêter sur des activités illégales ou des violations de nos conditions et politiques (par exemple, identifier ou enquêter sur une utilisation abusive de nos produits ou systèmes) ;
        *   protéger la sécurité de nos produits, systèmes et utilisateurs ;
        *   respecter une obligation légale, telle que la conservation des éléments de preuve ; ou
        *   nous conformer à la demande d’une autorité judiciaire ou administrative, d’une autorité d’application de la loi ou d’un organisme gouvernemental ;
    *   auquel cas, le contenu ne sera pas conservé plus longtemps qu’il n’est nécessaire aux fins pour lesquelles il a été conservé (la durée exacte variant au cas par cas).
*   Si vous supprimez ou si nous désactivons votre compte, les présentes Conditions prendront fin en tant qu’accord entre vous et nous, mais cette section et celle ci-dessous appelée « Notre accord et ce qu’il se passe en cas de désaccord » resteront applicables même après la résiliation, la désactivation ou la suppression de votre compte.

ota16,2021-02-23,2021-02-23--10-43-13.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,"December 20, 2020","Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or “Terms”) govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the “Service”), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Facebook Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=igtos), provided to you by Facebook, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook, Inc.  
### **The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content)) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
### **How Our Service Is Funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the [Facebook Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?helpref=page_content). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](http://help.instagram.com/537518769659039?helpref=page_content).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/116947042301556?helpref=page_content).
### **The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=page_content) explains how we collect, use, and share information across the [Facebook Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?helpref=page_content). It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the [Instagram Privacy and Security Settings](http://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?helpref=page_content). You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.
### **Your Commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
**Who Can Use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
*   You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum legal age in your country to use Instagram.

*   We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
*   You must not be a convicted sex offender.
**How You Can't Use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.
*   **You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**  
    You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
*   **You can't do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorized purpose.**
*   **You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?helpref=page_content), [Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/terms), and [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines)**.  
    If you post branded content, you must comply with our [Branded Content Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/brandedcontent/), which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our [Help Center](http://help.instagram.com/?helpref=page_content).
*   **You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.**  
    This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
*   **You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorized ways.**  
    This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
*   **You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service.**  
    This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.
*   **You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).**  
    You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, [here](http://help.instagram.com/535503073130320?helpref=page_content).
*   **You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer our products or their components.**
*   **You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.**
**Permissions You Give to Us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](http://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) and visit the [Instagram Help Center](http://help.instagram.com/).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads, and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](http://help.instagram.com/615366948510230) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
### **Additional Rights We Retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://www.instagram-brand.com/) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
### **Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account**
*   We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119)), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](http://help.instagram.com/477434105621119)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Center](http://help.instagram.com/). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled, or deleted.
### **Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**
**Our Agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines), and your use of our API is subject to our [Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/terms). If you use certain other features or related services, additional terms will be made available and will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**
*   Our Service is provided ""as is,"" and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
*   We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.
*   Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called ""liability"") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible (""liable"") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or account.
**How We Will Handle Disputes.**
> If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms (""claim""), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Facebook Inc. may also bring any claim we have against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere, or engage with our products in unauthorized ways in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.
**Unsolicited Material.**
> We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
### **Updating These Terms**
We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).

**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help.

ota27,2021-11-08,2021-11-08--10-05-30.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,20 December 2020,"Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a Contract Summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products. Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information – including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) – in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Facebook Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram. We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.

Permissions you give to us. As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)

Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.

Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products. Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information – including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) – in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Facebook Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose.

If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree

If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.

        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.

*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
**How we will handle disputes.**
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.  
If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
**Unsolicited material.**
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
**Updating these Terms**
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).  
Revised: 20 December 2020"
ota69,2021-12-14,2021-12-14--16-29-10.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,20 December 2020,"Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a Contract Summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products. Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information – including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) – in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Research and innovation.We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Facebook Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.

These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a Contract Summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products. Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information – including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) – in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.

As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account.

We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Facebook Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.

We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)

ota81,2021-12-25,2021-12-25--00-35-41.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,20 December 2020,"Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a Contract Summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Facebook Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Facebook Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Facebook Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Facebook Company Products. Instagram is part of the Facebook Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information – including the information we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) – in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Facebook Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Facebook Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Facebook Inc., Facebook Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Facebook Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Facebook Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Facebook Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram. We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

Revised: 20 December 2020"
ota97,2022-01-02,2022-01-02--00-35-57.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Facebook Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram. We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

Permissions you give to us. As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).

Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Facebook Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.

The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.

As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).

Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).

We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Facebook Products and Facebook Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins.

After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.

If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.

*   **You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos), [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/terms) and [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines)**.

**Permissions you give to us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
**Additional rights we retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://www.instagram-brand.com/) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
**Content removal and disabling or terminating your account**
*   We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
**Our agreement and what happens if we disagree**
**Our agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines), and your use of our API is subject to our [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/terms). If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who has rights under this agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who is responsible if something happens.**
*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
**How we will handle disputes.**
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.  
If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
**Unsolicited material.**
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
**Updating these Terms**
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).  
Revised: 4 January 2022"
ota105,2022-01-07,2022-01-07--18-35-42.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account here.

ota109,2022-01-13,2022-01-13--10-23-41.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)

This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law.

You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.

ota111,2022-01-13,2022-01-13--18-35-32.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)

How you can't use Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't modify, translate, create derivative works of or reverse engineer our products or their components.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota117,2022-01-16,2022-01-16--06-36-17.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.

This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law.

Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you.

As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota127,2022-01-22,2022-01-22--12-35-29.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must be at least 13 years old.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.

Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota131,2022-01-24,2022-01-24--00-35-30.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)

You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)

Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota133,2022-01-24,2022-01-24--12-35-35.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law.

You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).

We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota134,2022-01-24,2022-01-24--13-25-46.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota141,2022-01-25,2022-01-25--00-34-49.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you.

As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.

The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota143,2022-01-25,2022-01-25--12-34-53.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must be at least 13 years old.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must not be a convicted sex offender.
How you can't use Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, here.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't modify, translate, create derivative works of or reverse engineer our products or their components.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota149,2022-01-26,2022-01-26--00-34-49.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must be at least 13 years old.

How you can't use Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

How you can't use Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota155,2022-01-28,2022-01-28--00-34-28.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota159,2022-01-29,2022-01-29--00-34-25.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You must be at least 13 years old.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You must not be a convicted sex offender.
How you can't use Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota163,2022-01-30,2022-01-30--18-34-41.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.

If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law.

Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account.

For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.

You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota167,2022-02-03,2022-02-03--12-34-30.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share.

You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you.

As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota171,2022-02-04,2022-02-04--06-34-44.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you.

As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.

Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.

You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.

Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota175,2022-02-08,2022-02-08--12-35-23.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

How you can't use Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share.

You can't modify, translate, create derivative works of or reverse engineer our products or their components.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota183,2022-02-16,2022-02-16--12-34-33.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information. You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the Instagram Community Guidelines, Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies and Music Guidelines. If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service. This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law.

You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota187,2022-02-19,2022-02-19--18-35-34.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.

Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)

We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.
Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.

The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

You must be at least 13 years old.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota199,2022-02-28,2022-02-28--12-34-56.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. [_Learn more about Meta_](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.facebook.com%2Fmeta) and our vision for the metaverse._
Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
Click [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1190972084654673) for a contract summary and [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F430517971668717) for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide.  
If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the [Platform to Business Notice](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fplatformtobusinessnotice), which supplements our Terms of Use.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Digtos), provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos)) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
**How our Service is funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience.

Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039).

*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
**Additional rights we retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram-brand.com%2F) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
**Content removal and disabling or terminating your account**
*   We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
**Our agreement and what happens if we disagree**
**Our agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines), and your use of our API is subject to our [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms). If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpayments_terms). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who has rights under this agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who is responsible if something happens.**
*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
**How we will handle disputes.**
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.  
If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
**Unsolicited material.**
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
**Updating these Terms**
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).  
Revised: 4 January 2022"
ota200,2022-02-28,2022-02-28--18-34-58.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.

We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/y9/r/kw_DObTHKd4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota203,2022-03-01,2022-03-01--00-34-52.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Digtos), provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos)) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
**How our Service is funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F116947042301556).
**The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) explains how we collect, use and share information across the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Dtos). It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the [Instagram privacy and security settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos). You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.
**Your commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
**Who can use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
*   You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum legal age in your country to use Instagram.
*   You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
*   We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
*   You must not be a convicted sex offender.
**How you can't use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.
*   **You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**  
    You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
*   **You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.**
*   **You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos), [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms) and [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines)**.  
    If you post branded content, you must comply with our [Branded Content Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpolicies%2Fbrandedcontent%2F), which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/).
*   **You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.**  
    This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
*   **You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways.**  
    This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
*   **You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service.**  
    This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
*   **You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).**  
    You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F535503073130320%3Fref%3Digtos).
*   **You can't modify, translate, create derivative works of or reverse engineer our products or their components.**
*   **You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.**
**Permissions you give to us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Meta Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
**Additional rights we retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram-brand.com%2F) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
**Content removal and disabling or terminating your account**
*   We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)) or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
**Our agreement and what happens if we disagree**
**Our agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines), and your use of our API is subject to our [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms). If you use certain other features or related services, additional terms will be made available and will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpayments_terms). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who has rights under this agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.

**Who is responsible if something happens.**
*   Our Service is provided ""as is"", and we can't guarantee that it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time.

Revised: 4 January 2022"
ota204,2022-03-01,2022-03-01--06-34-58.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=igtos), provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos)) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
**How our Service is funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/195227921252400?ref=dp). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/116947042301556).
**The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) explains how we collect, use and share information across the [Meta Products](https://www.facebook.com/help/1561485474074139?ref=tos). It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the [Instagram privacy and security settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos). You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.
**Your commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
**Who can use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
*   You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum legal age in your country to use Instagram.
*   You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
*   We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
*   You must not be a convicted sex offender.
**How you can't use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.
*   **You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**  
    You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
*   **You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.**
*   **You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos), [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/terms) and [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines)**.  
    If you post branded content, you must comply with our [Branded Content Policies](https://www.facebook.com/policies/brandedcontent/), which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/).
*   **You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.**  
    This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
*   **You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways.**  
    This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
*   **You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service.**  
    This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
*   **You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).**  
    You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, [here](http://help.instagram.com/535503073130320?ref=igtos).
*   **You can't modify, translate, create derivative works of or reverse engineer our products or their components.**
*   **You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.**
**Permissions you give to us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Meta Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
**Additional rights we retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://www.instagram-brand.com/) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
**Content removal and disabling or terminating your account**
*   We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)) or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
**Our agreement and what happens if we disagree**
**Our agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://www.facebook.com/legal/music_guidelines), and your use of our API is subject to our [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/terms). If you use certain other features or related services, additional terms will be made available and will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://www.facebook.com/payments_terms). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who has rights under this agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who is responsible if something happens.**
*   Our Service is provided ""as is"", and we can't guarantee that it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
*   We also don't control what people and others do or say, and we aren't responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren't responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.
*   Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called ""liability"") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible (""liable"") for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know that they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information or account.
**How we will handle disputes.**
If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms (""claim""), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Meta Platforms Inc. may also bring any claim that we have against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere or engage with our products in unauthorised ways in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.
**Unsolicited material.**
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
**Updating these Terms**
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota213,2022-03-03,2022-03-03T06-34-59Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. [_Learn more about Meta_](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.facebook.com%2Fmeta&h=removed) and our vision for the metaverse._
Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
Click [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1190972084654673&h=removed) for a contract summary and [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F430517971668717&h=removed) for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide.  
If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the [Platform to Business Notice](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fplatformtobusinessnotice&h=removed), which supplements our Terms of Use.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Digtos&h=removed), provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos)) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
**How our Service is funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp&h=removed). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F116947042301556&h=removed).
**The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) explains how we collect, use and share information across the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Dtos&h=removed). It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the [Instagram privacy and security settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos).
**Your commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
**Who can use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
*   You must be at least 13 years old.
*   You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
*   We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
*   You must not be a convicted sex offender.
**How you can't use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.

    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).

For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos) about your ad settings.

**Content removal and disabling or terminating your account**
*   We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
**Our agreement and what happens if we disagree**
**Our agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines&h=removed), and your use of our API is subject to our [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms&h=removed). If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpayments_terms&h=removed). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who has rights under this agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who is responsible if something happens.**
*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
**How we will handle disputes.**
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.  
If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
**Unsolicited material.**
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
**Updating these Terms**
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).  
Revised: 4 January 2022"
ota214,2022-03-03,2022-03-03T08-12-21Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.

You must be at least 13 years old.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)

in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mDTpWxQkHlU.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota216,2022-03-03,2022-03-03T14-39-02Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. [_Learn more about Meta_](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.facebook.com%2Fmeta&h=removed) and our vision for the metaverse._
Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
Click [here](https://help.instagram.com/http%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1190972084654673&h=removed) for a contract summary and [here](https://help.instagram.com/http%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F430517971668717&h=removed) for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide.  
If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the [Platform to Business Notice](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fplatformtobusinessnotice&h=removed), which supplements our Terms of Use.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Digtos&h=removed), provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos)) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
**How our Service is funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp&h=removed). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F116947042301556&h=removed).
**The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) explains how we collect, use and share information across the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Dtos&h=removed). It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the [Instagram privacy and security settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos).
**Your commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
**Who can use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
*   You must be at least 13 years old.
*   You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
*   We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
*   You must not be a convicted sex offender.
**How you can't use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.
*   **You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**  
    You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
*   **You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.**
*   **You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos), [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms&h=removed) and [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines&h=removed)**.  
    If you post branded content, you must comply with our [Branded Content Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpolicies%2Fbrandedcontent%2F&h=removed), which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/).
*   **You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.**  
    This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
*   **You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways.**  
    This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
*   **You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service.**  
    This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
*   **You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).**  
    You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, [here](https://help.instagram.com/http%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F535503073130320%3Fref%3Digtos&h=removed).
*   **You can't modify, translate, create derivative works of or reverse engineer our products or their components.**
*   **You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.**
**Permissions you give to us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
**Additional rights we retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram-brand.com%2F&h=removed) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
**Content removal and disabling or terminating your account**
*   We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;

Revised: 4 January 2022"
ota218,2022-03-06,2022-03-06T17-24-39Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You must be at least 13 years old.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)

However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.

If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).

ota220,2022-03-22,2022-03-22T17-34-11Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must be at least 13 years old.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must not be a convicted sex offender.
How you can't use Instagram.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.

Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota222,2022-03-24,2022-03-24T09-31-36Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must be at least 13 years old.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must not be a convicted sex offender.
How you can't use Instagram.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content. You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.

If you post branded content, you must comply with our Branded Content Policies, which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service. This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota224,2022-03-24,2022-03-24T14-18-22Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Digtos&h=removed), provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos)) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
**How our Service is funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp&h=removed). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F116947042301556&h=removed).
**The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) explains how we collect, use and share information across the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Dtos&h=removed). It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the [Instagram privacy and security settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos). You must agree to the Data Policy to use Instagram.
**Your commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
**Who can use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
*   You must be at least 13 years old or the minimum legal age in your country to use Instagram.
*   You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
*   We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
*   You must not be a convicted sex offender.
**How you can't use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.
*   **You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**  
    You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
*   **You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.**
*   **You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos), [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms&h=removed) and [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines&h=removed)**.  
    If you post branded content, you must comply with our [Branded Content Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpolicies%2Fbrandedcontent%2F&h=removed), which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/).
*   **You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.**  
    This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.
*   **You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways.**  
    This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
*   **You can't sell, licence or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service.**  
    This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
*   **You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).**  
    You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F535503073130320%3Fref%3Digtos&h=removed).
*   **You can't modify, translate, create derivative works of or reverse engineer our products or their components.**
*   **You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.**
**Permissions you give to us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Meta Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
**Additional rights we retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram-brand.com%2F&h=removed) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
**Content removal and disabling or terminating your account**
*   We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)) or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
**Our agreement and what happens if we disagree**
**Our agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines&h=removed), and your use of our API is subject to our [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms&h=removed). If you use certain other features or related services, additional terms will be made available and will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpayments_terms&h=removed). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who has rights under this agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who is responsible if something happens.**
*   Our Service is provided ""as is"", and we can't guarantee that it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
*   We also don't control what people and others do or say, and we aren't responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren't responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.
*   Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called ""liability"") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible (""liable"") for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know that they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information or account.
**How we will handle disputes.**
If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms (""claim""), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Meta Platforms Inc. may also bring any claim that we have against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere or engage with our products in unauthorised ways in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.
**Unsolicited material.**
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
**Updating these Terms**
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the Data Policy and visit the Instagram Help Centre.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Meta Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more here about your ad settings.

You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.

![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can't attempt to create accounts or access or collect information in unauthorised ways. This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Additional rights we retain
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our Brand Guidelines or with our prior written permission.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, additional terms will be made available and will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our Service is provided ""as is"", and we can't guarantee that it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
We also don't control what people and others do or say, and we aren't responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren't responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yy/r/Gfv6WsB4dT4.png)
Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called ""liability"") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible (""liable"") for any lost profits, revenues, information or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know that they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information or account.
How we will handle disputes.
If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms (""claim""), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the US District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, Meta Platforms Inc. may also bring any claim that we have against you related to efforts to abuse, interfere or engage with our products in unauthorised ways in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota228,2022-03-30,2022-03-30T12-34-41Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. Learn more about Meta and our vision for the metaverse.
Welcome to Instagram! These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service. Click here for a contract summary and here for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide. If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the Platform to Business Notice, which supplements our Terms of Use. The Instagram Service is one of the Meta Products, provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.
The Instagram Service
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share. People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment. We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the Data Policy.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community. Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products. Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the Data Policy) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Ensuring access to our Service. To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about. We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Research and innovation. We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
How our Service is funded
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the Meta Company Products. We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work here.
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this here.
The Data Policy
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The Data Policy explains how we collect, use and share information across the Meta Products. It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the Instagram privacy and security settings.
Your commitments
Who can use Instagram.
We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You must be at least 13 years old.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments-related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You must not be a convicted sex offender.
How you can't use Instagram.
Permissions you give to us.
As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it. Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).

Content removal and disabling or terminating your account
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our Instagram Community Guidelines), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our Help Centre. When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
where deletion would restrict our ability to:
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
Our agreement and what happens if we disagree
Our agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our Music Guidelines, and your use of our API is subject to our Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies. If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the Community Payment Terms. If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
Who has rights under this agreement.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
Who is responsible if something happens.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/rsrc.php/v3/yO/r/mtULD14k7ag.png)
The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
How we will handle disputes.
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions. If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
Unsolicited material.
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
Updating these Terms
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account

ota230,2022-04-04,2022-04-04T00-34-39Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,"4 January, 2022","Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We’ve updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy, and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on January 4, 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. [_Learn more about Meta_](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.facebook.com%2Fmeta&h=removed) and our vision for the metaverse._
Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or “Terms”) govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the “Service”), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
Click [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1190972084654673&h=removed) for a Contract Summary and [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F430517971668717&h=removed) for other information we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide.  
If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the [Platform to Business Notice](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fplatformtobusinessnotice&h=removed) which supplements our Terms of Use.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Digtos&h=removed), provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos)) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to develop, test, and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
**How Our Service Is Funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp&h=removed). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F116947042301556&h=removed).
**The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875) explains how we collect, use, and share information across the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Dtos&h=removed). It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the [Instagram Privacy and Security Settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos).
**Your Commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.
**Who Can Use Instagram.** We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions in order to be part of the Instagram community.
*   You must be at least 13 years old.
*   You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our Service under applicable laws or engaging in payments related Services if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
*   We must not have previously disabled your account for violation of law or any of our policies.
*   You must not be a convicted sex offender.
**How You Can't Use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.
*   **You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**  
    You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up to date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data.

    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).

For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow.

*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
**Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account**
*   We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)), or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos)), if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights, or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems, or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled, or deleted.
**Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**
**Our Agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines&h=removed), and your use of our API is subject to our [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms&h=removed). If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpayments_terms&h=removed). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**
*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure, and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. Provided we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury, or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
**How We Will Handle Disputes.**
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.  
If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
**Unsolicited Material.**
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
**Updating These Terms**
We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account, [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos).  
Revised: 4 January, 2022"
ota231,2022-04-08,2022-04-08T18-34-33Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,"4 January, 2022","Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We’ve updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy, and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on January 4, 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. [_Learn more about Meta_](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.facebook.com%2Fmeta&h=removed) and our vision for the metaverse._
Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or “Terms”) govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the “Service”), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
Click [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1190972084654673%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed) for a Contract Summary and [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F430517971668717%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed) for other information we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide.  
If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the [Platform to Business Notice](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fplatformtobusinessnotice&h=removed) which supplements our Terms of Use.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Digtos%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed), provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content)) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to develop, test, and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
**How Our Service Is Funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039?helpref=faq_content).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F116947042301556%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed).
**The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=faq_content) explains how we collect, use, and share information across the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Dtos%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed). It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the [Instagram Privacy and Security Settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos).
**Your Commitments**

In some cases when we remove content, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems, or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Center](https://help.instagram.com/). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled, or deleted.
**Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**
**Our Agreement.**

**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.**
*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure, and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections.

Revised: 4 January, 2022"
ota232,2022-04-12,2022-04-12T06-35-01Z.md,Instagram,terms_of_service,4 January 2022,"Facebook Ireland Limited has changed its name to Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. We've updated our Terms of Use, Data Policy and Cookies Policy to reflect the new name on 4 January 2022. While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. [_Learn more about Meta_](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.facebook.com%2Fmeta&h=removed) and our vision for the metaverse._
Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
Click [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1190972084654673%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed) for a contract summary and [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F430517971668717%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed) for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide.  
If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the [Platform to Business Notice](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fplatformtobusinessnotice&h=removed), which supplements our Terms of Use.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Digtos%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed), provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies, and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalized opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover, and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join, and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive, and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights, and information-including the information we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content)) in order to provide services that are better, safer, and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited, or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products, and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to develop, test, and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
**How Our Service Is Funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organizations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don’t sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things like their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don’t share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039?helpref=faq_content).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F116947042301556%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed).
**The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=faq_content) explains how we collect, use, and share information across the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Dtos%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed). It also explains the many ways you can control your information, including in the [Instagram Privacy and Security Settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos).
**Your Commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.

    This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.

*   **You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit, or pirated goods).**  
    You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F535503073130320%3Fref%3Digtos%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed).

**Permissions you give to us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
**Additional Rights We Retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).

While our company name has changed, we are continuing to offer the same products, including Instagram from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Use remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. [_Learn more about Meta_](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.facebook.com%2Fmeta&h=removed) and our vision for the metaverse._
Welcome to Instagram!  
These Terms of Use (or ""Terms"") govern your use of Instagram, except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these) apply, and provide information about the Instagram Service (the ""Service""), outlined below. When you create an Instagram account or use Instagram, you agree to these Terms. The Meta Terms of Service do not apply to this Service.  
Click [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F1190972084654673%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed) for a contract summary and [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F430517971668717%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed) for other information that we are required by the European Electronic Communications Code to provide.  
If you are a business established in the EU and use Instagram Shopping to sell goods to consumers located in the EU, you can learn more about your commercial relationship with us by reviewing the [Platform to Business Notice](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fplatformtobusinessnotice&h=removed), which supplements our Terms of Use.  
The Instagram Service is one of the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Digtos%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed), provided to you by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited. These Terms of Use therefore constitute an agreement between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited.  
**The Instagram Service**
We agree to provide you with the Instagram Service. The Service includes all of the Instagram products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we provide to advance Instagram's mission: To bring you closer to the people and things you love. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
*   **Offering personalised opportunities to create, connect, communicate, discover and share.**  
    People are different. We want to strengthen your relationships through shared experiences that you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, join and share in experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers and accounts that you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience Instagram, based on things that you and others do on and off Instagram.
*   **Fostering a positive, inclusive and safe environment.**  
    We develop and use tools and offer resources to our community members that help to make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We also have teams and systems that work to combat abuse and breaches of our Terms and Policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behaviour. We use all the information we have – including your information – to try to keep our platform secure. We may also share information about misuse or harmful content with other Meta Companies or law enforcement. Learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content).
*   **Developing and using technologies that help us consistently serve our growing community.**  
    Organising and analysing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalise, protect and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad global community. Technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us to ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
*   **Providing consistent and seamless experiences across other Meta Company Products.**  
    Instagram is part of the Meta Companies, which share technology, systems, insights and information – including the information that we have about you (learn more in the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content)) in order to provide services that are better, safer and more secure. We also provide ways to interact across the Meta Company Products that you use, and have designed systems to achieve a seamless and consistent experience across the Meta Company Products.
*   **Ensuring access to our Service.**  
    To operate our global Service, we must store and transfer data across our systems around the world, including outside of your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our Service. This infrastructure may be owned or operated by Meta Platforms, Inc., Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or their affiliates.
*   **Connecting you with brands, products and services in ways you care about.**  
    We use data from Instagram and other Meta Company Products, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on Instagram.
*   **Research and innovation.**  
    We use the information we have to develop, test and improve our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community. This includes analysing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Services, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features.
**How our Service is funded**
Instead of paying to use Instagram, by using the Service covered by these Terms, you acknowledge that we can show you ads that businesses and organisations pay us to promote on and off the [Meta Company Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F195227921252400%3Fref%3Ddp%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed). We use your personal data, such as information about your activity and interests, to show you ads that are more relevant to you.
We show you relevant and useful ads without telling advertisers who you are. We don't sell your personal data. We allow advertisers to tell us things such as their business goal and the kind of audience they want to see their ads. We then show their ad to people who might be interested.
We also provide advertisers with reports about the performance of their ads to help them understand how people are interacting with their content on and off Instagram. For example, we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers to help them better understand their audience. We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us specific permission. Learn more about how Instagram ads work [here](https://help.instagram.com/537518769659039?helpref=faq_content).
You may see branded content on Instagram posted by account holders who promote products or services based on a commercial relationship with the business partner mentioned in their content. You can learn more about this [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2Finstagram%2F116947042301556%3Fhelpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed).
**The Data Policy**
Providing our Service requires collecting and using your information. The [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875?helpref=faq_content) explains how we collect, use and share information across the [Meta Products](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1561485474074139%3Fref%3Dtos%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed). It also explains the many ways in which you can control your information, including in the [Instagram privacy and security settings](https://help.instagram.com/285881641526716?ref=igtos).
**Your commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.

**How you can't use Instagram.** Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that we all do our part.
*   **You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.**  
    You don't have to disclose your identity on Instagram, but you must provide us with accurate and up-to-date information (including registration information), which may include providing personal data. Also, you may not impersonate someone or something you aren't, and you can't create an account for someone else unless you have their express permission.
*   **You can't do anything unlawful, misleading or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorised purpose.**
*   **You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in particular the [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content), [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms&h=removed) and [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines&h=removed)**.  
    If you post branded content, you must comply with our [Branded Content Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpolicies%2Fbrandedcontent%2F&h=removed), which require you to use our branded content tool. Learn how to report conduct or content in our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/).

    This includes misusing any reporting, dispute or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless reports or appeals.

    This includes creating accounts or collecting information in an automated way without our express permission.

    This includes attempts to buy, sell or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords or misappropriate access tokens.
*   **You can't post someone else's private or confidential information without permission or do anything that violates someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g. copyright infringement, trademark infringement, counterfeit or pirated goods).**  
    You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable law. You represent that you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share. Learn more, including how to report content that you think infringes your intellectual property rights, [here](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=http%3A%2F%2Fhelp.instagram.com%2F535503073130320%3Fref%3Digtos%26helpref%3Dfaq_content&h=removed).
*   **You can't modify, translate, create derivative works of or reverse engineer our products or their components.**
*   **You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.**
**Permissions you give to us.** As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to provide the Service.
*   **We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a licence to use it.**  
    Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on or through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you choose. However, we need certain legal permissions from you (known as a ""licence"") to provide the Service. When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (such as photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide licence to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This licence will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. To learn more about how we use information, and how to control or delete your content, review the [Data Policy](https://help.instagram.com/155833707900388?ref=igtos) and visit the [Instagram Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/?ref=igtos).
*   **Permission to use your username, profile picture and information about your relationships and actions with accounts, ads and sponsored content.**  
    You give us permission to show your username, profile picture and information about your actions (such as likes) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers and other sponsored content that you follow or engage with that are displayed on Facebook Products, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on Instagram. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings. You can learn more [here](https://help.instagram.com/615366948510230?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content) about your ad settings.
*   **You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.**
**Additional rights we retain**
*   If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate or necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).
*   If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights to our content (but not yours).
*   You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks as expressly permitted by our [Brand Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram-brand.com%2F&h=removed) or with our prior written permission.
*   You must obtain written permission from us or under an open-source licence to modify, create derivative works of, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
**Content removal and disabling or terminating your account**
*   We can remove any content or information that you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of Use, our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content)) or we are required to do so by law. We can refuse to provide or stop providing all or part of the Service to you (including terminating or disabling your access to the Meta Products and Meta Company Products) immediately to protect our community or services, or if you create risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our [Instagram Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content)), if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so by law. We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate adverse legal or regulatory impacts on us. In some cases when we remove content, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms, or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. If you believe that your account has been terminated in error, or you want to disable or permanently delete your account, consult our [Help Centre](https://help.instagram.com/). When you request to delete content or your account, the deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to delete content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the content is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the content is deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.
*   Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the following situations:
    *   where your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence and they have not deleted it (in which case this licence will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or
    *   where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or
    *   where deletion would restrict our ability to:
        *   investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our products or systems);
        *   protect the safety and security of our products, systems and users;
        *   comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or
        *   comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
    *   in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
*   If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but this section and the section below called ""Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree"" will still apply even after your account is terminated, disabled or deleted.
**Our agreement and what happens if we disagree**
**Our agreement.**
*   Your use of music on the Service is also subject to our [Music Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Flegal%2Fmusic_guidelines&h=removed), and your use of our API is subject to our [Meta Platform Terms and Developer Policies](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.facebook.com%2Fterms&h=removed). If you use certain other features or related services, you will be provided with an opportunity to agree to additional terms that will also become a part of our agreement. For example, if you use payment features, you will be asked to agree to the [Community Payment Terms](https://help.instagram.com/https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpayments_terms&h=removed). If any of those terms conflict with this agreement, those other terms will govern.
*   If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
*   Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
*   We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
**Who has rights under this agreement.**
*   This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
*   You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
*   Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition or sale of assets) or by law.
**Who is responsible if something happens.**
*   We will use reasonable skill and care in providing our Service to you and in keeping a safe, secure and error-free environment, but we cannot guarantee that our Service will always function without disruptions, delays or imperfections. Provided that we have acted with reasonable skill and care, we do not accept responsibility for: losses not caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses which are not reasonably foreseeable by you and us at the time of entering into these Terms; any offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful or otherwise objectionable content posted by others that you may encounter on our Service; and events beyond our reasonable control.
*   The above does not exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent misrepresentation caused by our negligence. It also does not exclude or limit our liability for any other things where the law does not permit us to do so.
**How we will handle disputes.**
If a claim or dispute arises out of or relates to your use of the Service as a consumer, both you and us agree that you may resolve your individual claim or dispute against us, and we may resolve our claim or dispute against you, in any competent court in the country of your main residence that has jurisdiction over your claim or dispute, and the laws of that country will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.  
If a claim or dispute arises between us that relates to use of the Service in any other capacity, including, but not limited to, access or use of the Service for a business or commercial purpose, you agree that any such claim or dispute must be resolved in a competent court in Ireland and that Irish law will apply without regard to conflict of law provisions.
**Unsolicited material.**
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
**Updating these Terms**
We may change our Service and Policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and Policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account [here](https://help.instagram.com/370452623149242?ref=igtos&helpref=faq_content).
