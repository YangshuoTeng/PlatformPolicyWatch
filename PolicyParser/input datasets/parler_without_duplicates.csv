Any virtual token balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent of your ability to procure such limited license to use certain features made available via the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time Parler may make available a feature where Virtual Items may be redeemed for cash. Parler prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items 3   effectuated  outside  of  the  Services,  or  the  purported  sale,  gift,  or  trade  in  the  real world  of  anything  that  appears  or  originates  in  the  Services,  unless  otherwise expressly authorized by Parler in writing. Accordingly, you may not sublicense, trade, sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Items for real money, or exchange Virtual Items for value of  any  kind  outside of the Services, without Parler’s written permission. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void and will subject your account to termination. You are responsible for all taxes arising out of your use of the Services, including without limitation any taxes due upon your redemption of the Virtual Items for cash. If you redeem Virtual Items for cash, you may be required to supply a social security number and/or tax identification number prior to the issuance of the cash redemption to you. Parler may file an IRS form 1099 or similar form with the Internal Revenue Service or the appropriate tax filing with a governmental entity for the fair market value of any cash redemptions issued to you in exchange for the Virtual items.  7.

Upon receiving a notice satisfying these requirements, Parler will take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate, including removal of the challenged content from the services.  8. You  may  not  interfere  with  the  Services  in  any  way,  such  as  by  accessing  the Services through automated means in a manner that puts excessive demand on the  Services;  by  hacking  the  Services;  by  accessing  without  authorization  areas  of  the Services that are protected by technical measures designed to prevent unauthorized access;  by  testing  the  vulnerability  of  the  Services;  by  impersonating  Parler  on the Services; by accessing the Services for any purpose that competes with the interests of  Parler;  by  spamming  Parler  community  members;  by  failing  to  respond  to operational  communications  or  requests  from  Parler;  or  through  any  other  type  of interference with the Services or Parler’s relationships with others.   9. Parler may remove any content and terminate your access to the Services at any time and for any reason to the extent Parler reasonably believes (a) you have violated 4   these Terms or Parler’s Community Guidelines, (b) you create risk or possible legal exposure for Parler, or (c) you are otherwise engaging in unlawful conduct—although Parler endeavors to allow all free speech that is lawful and does not infringe the legal rights of others. Any invitation made by Parler to you to use the Services or submit content to the Services, or the fact that Parler may receive a benefit from your use of the Services or provision of content to the Services, will not obligate Parler to maintain any content or maintain your access to the Services.

Parler has no responsibility or liability to you  arising  from  hacking  event,  data  breach,  theft,  misuse  of  information, conspiracy,  racket,  fraud,  act  of  terrorism,  misappropriation  of  information, technical malfunction, interruption of service, or similar event that may cause you to suffer damage, loss, or injury, including without limitation any damage to or loss of  your  personal  property,  data,  operations,  information,  reputation,  goodwill, profits, etc.   TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AND REGARD-    LESS OF THE NATURE OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION, PARLER WILL NOT BE   LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, WHETHER  5   INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR FOR INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING FROM (a) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE) THE SERVICES; (b) FROM THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF ANY OTHER PERSON   OR  THIRD  PARTY,  INCLUDING,  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  ANY  DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER PERSONS OR THIRD PARTIES; (c)  ANY  CONTENT  OBTAINED  FROM  THE  SERVICES;  OR  (d)  UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS,  USE,  OR  ALTERATION  OF  YOUR  CONTENT  OR  COMMUNICATIONS THROUGH THE SERVICES.

THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION  SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY,  CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND SHALL FURTHER APPLY WHETHER OR NOT PARLER HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY LAID OUT IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.        12. Applicable law and jurisdiction. The laws of the State of Nevada, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Parler. All disputes related to these Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the state or federal courts located in Clark County, Nevada, United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.    13. You  affirm  that  you  are  competent  to  agree  to  be  bound  by  this  Agreement, meaning that you are over the age of 18, an emancipated minor, or have legal parental or guardian consent. Parents of minors should be aware that, in addition to the NSFW filters made available by Parler, there are a number of Parental Control products and features available on the market, which can help you tailor your child’s experience on our platform.

Parler prohibits and does not recognize any purported transfers of Virtual Items effectuated  outside  of  the  Services,  or  the  purported  sale,  gift,  or  trade  in  the  real world  of  anything  that  appears  or  originates  in  the  Services,  unless  otherwise expressly authorized by Parler in writing. Accordingly, you may not sublicense, trade, sell, or attempt to sell Virtual Items for real money, or exchange Virtual Items for value 3   of  any  kind  outside of the Services, without Parler’s written permission. Any such transfer or attempted transfer is prohibited and void and will subject your account to termination. You are responsible for all taxes arising out of your use of the Services, including without limitation any taxes due upon your redemption of the Virtual Items for cash. If you redeem Virtual Items for cash, you may be required to supply a social security number and/or tax identification number prior to the issuance of the cash redemption to you. Parler may file an IRS form 1099 or similar form with the Internal Revenue Service or the appropriate tax filing with a governmental entity for the fair market value of any cash redemptions issued to you in exchange for the Virtual items.  7.

THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION  SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY,  CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND SHALL FURTHER APPLY WHETHER OR NOT PARLER HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBLITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY LAID OUT IN THESE TERMS IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.        12. Applicable law and dispute resolution procedure.  (a) The laws of Washington, DC will govern these Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Parler. You agree that all disputes related to these Terms or the Services will first be mediated, in good faith, within sixty (60) days of the demanding party’s provision of a written demand, unless expressly agreed otherwise in a signed writing. In the event that a full settlement is not achieved during mediation, you agree that any dispute, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any right arising out of these Terms or otherwise, shall then be settled exclusively by arbitration as set forth hereunder and you hereby waive the right to a jury trial before any court of competent jurisdiction. (b) Jury Trial Waiver. IN USING THE SERVICES, YOU THEREBY WAIVE A TRIAL BY JURY  IN  ANY  ACTION,  PROCEEDING,  OR  COUNTER-CLAIM  BROUGHT  OR ASSERTED BY EITHER YOU OR PARLER AGAINST THE OTHER ON ANY MATTERS WHATSOEVER  RELATING  TO  OR ARISING  OUT  OF  THE  FORMATION  OF  AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES BASED ON THESE TERMS. (c) Requirement.  All  claims,  controversies,  disputes  and  other  matters  in  question arising out of, or relating to these Terms, the breach hereof or the rights, privileges, responsibilities  or  duties  between  or  among  you  and  Parler,  shall  be  decided  by confidential   arbitration   in   Washington,   DC,   USA   in   accordance   with   the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then existing,  unless  all  parties  to  any  such  claim,  controversy  or  dispute, or  other matter in question, unanimously agree to the contrary.

The parties will be entitled to conduct discovery in accordance with the provisions of Washington, DC’s applicable code of civil procedure. The remedial authority of the arbitrator  or  arbitrators  will  be  the  same  as,  but  no  greater  than,  would  be  the remedial power of a court having jurisdiction over the Parties and their dispute. The 7   arbitrator or arbitrators will render a written opinion based on Washington, DC law, and specifying an  award,  which  will  be  final  and  binding  upon  the  Parties.  13.
